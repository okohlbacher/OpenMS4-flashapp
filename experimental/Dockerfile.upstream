# This Dockerfile builds OpenMS, the TOPP tools, pyOpenMS and thidparty tools.
# It also adds a basic streamlit server that serves a pyOpenMS-based app.
# hints:
# build image and give it a name (here: streamlitapp) with: docker build --no-cache -t streamlitapp:latest --build-arg GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token> . 2>&1 | tee build.log
# check if image was build: docker image ls
# run container: docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlitappsimple:latest
# debug container after build (comment out ENTRYPOINT) and run container with interactive /bin/bash shell
# prune unused images/etc. to free disc space (e.g. might be needed on gitpod). Use with care.: docker system prune --all --force
